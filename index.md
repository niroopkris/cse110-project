## Research Projects (RSRI)
Worked with Professor Jhala and another Regents scholar on the following projects:
* **Wishlist** - A basic wishlist application (self-explanatory)
* **Voltron** - An application that groups students up and allows them to share code in a buffer
* **Course** - A general application that teachers and their students can use for their course
* **Conf** - An application for creating and viewing research papers

It was done using the Rust programming language and the Rocket framework. Here's a code snippet:
```
#[get("/home")]
pub fn home() -> Template {
    Template::render("home",  context!{})
}
```
